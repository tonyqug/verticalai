## 🚀 Features

✅ **Real-time Motion Tracking** – Detects and analyzes jumps using live camera input  
✅ **AI-Powered Analysis** – Uses computer vision to calculate jump height with high accuracy  
✅ **Physics-Based Estimations** – Applies airtime physics to derive precise performance metrics  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple setup with intuitive visuals  
✅ **Web-Based Deployment** – Works on modern browsers without additional software  

## 🎯 Use Cases

🏀 **Basketball** – Measure vertical jump for training and improvement  
🏐 **Volleyball** – Track jump height for spike and block performance  
🏃‍♂️ **Track & Field** – Analyze explosive jumping ability for high jump or long jump  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Computer Vision**: AI-powered tracking algorithms
- **Deployment**: Web-based, cross-platform compatibility

## 📸 How It Works

1. **Setup your camera** 📷 – Use a standard webcam or phone camera  
2. **Perform a jump** 🏃 – The system tracks and records your motion  
3. **AI analyzes the movement** 🧠 – Using computer vision and physics-based models  
4. **Get instant results** 📊 – View accurate jump height and analytics
